## Usage

For an overview of integrating FoxyCart into Craft utilising this plugin, see [Craft CMS integration notes](https://wiki.foxycart.com/integration/craftcms) on the FoxyCart wiki

### HMAC

To enable HMAC validation, simply wrap any links or forms (or your whole page if desired) in `{% hmac %}` and `{% endhmac %}` tags. Note that the add to cart requires a code. For more information see [this page](http://wiki.foxycart.com/static/redirect/price_validation "FoxyCart wiki on link/form validation")

### Events

#### foxyCart.onProcessWebhook

Raised whenever a webhook (transaction or subscription) is processed.

**Params:**

 - `xml` â€“ A decrypted _SimpleXMLElement_ instance of the received webhook payload.
 - `feedType` - A string describing the type of webhook received ("transaction" or "subscription")

### Variables

 - `craft.foxyCart.storedomain` - The store subdomain as set in your plugin settings.
 
### Fields

 - FoxyCart Category - Displays a dropdown of the categories as set within the FoxyCart store

### Reports

This plugin includes some very basic reports accessible from the "FoxyCart" CP section. This is more of a proof of concept currently than a full-fledged reports area. Currently when Craft is in devMode, test transactions are displayed, otherwise live transactions are displayed.

## Debugging

Some helpful debug messages are logged to a plugin specific log file of `foxycart.log`.
